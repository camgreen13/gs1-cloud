# GS1 Cloud GTIN CHECK (beta) and GTIN VIEW (experimental)

Programs to CHECK the validity of GTINS/EAN codes against the GS1 Cloud (BETA) CHECK API and VIEW the active GTINS from the VIEW API (experimental)

The GS1 Cloud will be the largest source of trusted product information in the world, making it possible for businesses to meet the expectations of todayâ€™s digital world.
For more information  <a href="https://www.gs1.org/services/gs1-cloud" target="_blank">GS1.org</a>.

**Install and usage notes**

2. Download the zip with the programfiles on your local machine and unpack and store it in a local map.
3. Put your credentials (email and api-key) in the file credentials.py. 
   The API key can be found in the <a href="https://cloud.gs1.org/gs1-portal/" target="_blank">GS1 Cloud user interface</a> 
   under 'Account'.
4. Use PIP install if there are any missing packages (e.g. ..>pip install requests)

**CHECK GS1_Cloud_CHECK_GTINS.py**
1. Add your set of GTINS in the file gtins.txt. 
   The GTINS have to be 14 digits long, including leading zero's. The attached file gtins.txt will generate most of the current messages.
2. Run the program in the shell program of your OS (..>python GS1_Cloud_CHECK_GTINS.py) or a Python IDE.<br>
   It will test about 35 GTINS per second. The program has been tested with up to 500.000 GTINS in one file.
3. Find the output in .\output\check_gtins_yyyymmdd_hhmmss.csv.<br>
   Also a log file is created as .\output\check_gtins_yyyymmdd_hhmmss.log<br>
   All active GTINS are listed in the file active_gtins.txt. This file is used as input for GS1_Cloud_VIEW_GTINS.py
4. View and analyze your results in a spreadsheet or database.

**VIEW GS1_Cloud_VIEW_GTINS.py**<br>
Please note:<br>
The VIEW API is experimental and at the moment only available for GS1 member organisations.
Until now you can only view items uploaded under your account. Therefor many active gtins (from other sources) 
give a 404 (not found) as result. These are listed in the log file.  

1. Run the program in the shell program of your OS (..>python GS1_Cloud_VIEW_GTINS.py) or a Python IDE. 
2. Find the output in .\output\view_gtins_yyyymmdd_hhmmss.csv.<br>
   Also a log file is created as .\output\view_gtins_yyyymmdd_hhmmss.log<br>
3. View and analyze your results in a spreadsheet or database.
